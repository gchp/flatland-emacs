### NOTE
This is still under development. Currently, this has only been tested in the GUI version of emacs, and not in the terminal.
If you find any issues, please report them on the Github Issue Tracker. Pull requests welcome :)

## Installation

### Manual

Download `flatland-theme.el` to the directory `~/.emacs.d/themes/`. Add this to your
`.emacs`:

```lisp
(add-to-list 'custom-theme-load-path "~/.emacs.d/themes/")
```

Now you can load the theme with the interactive function `load-theme` like this:

`M-x load-theme RET flatland`

Or, load load it automatically by placing this in your initialisation file:

```lisp
(load-theme 'flatland t)
```

### MELPA
You can also install flatland from MELPA.

```
M-x package-install RET flatland-theme
```

Then load the same way as above.


## Usage
For best use with HTML, you should check out `web-mode` which can be installed from MELPA. This theme has been optimised for use with web-mode rather than html-mode.
